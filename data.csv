"The Clippers just lost the 3rd q at Golden State 42-16. They are on their way to going 0-4 since inexplicably adding Russell Westbrook, who is on his way to going 0-14 in the last 14 games he has started.",N,,
"Still not sold on Luka/Kyrie fitting and working. They very nearly blew a 25-pt lead at home tonight after the 27-pt collapse to the Lakers. They were playing a tired, lifeless Philly on a road back-to-back and the Mavs made 25-48 threes! 52%! Aberration.",N,,

"Michael Jordan played all 82 games 9 times, including his final season at age 39. He also played 81 and 80. LeBron has played all 82 only once, but also has an 81 and an 80. AD has played all 82 zero times, but did manage 75 twice. MJ didn't let little aches and pains stop him",Y,,hating

"Westbrook has 8 assists in the first half. And of course, at home the Clippers trail the TWolves. Please don't tell me the Clippers are about to lose their third straight since they fell into the Westbrook trap that the Lakers escaped.",N,,
"On a final play clearly called for Kyrie, down 2, he took AND MISSED the 3 to win, guarded by Indy's McConnell. Luka just watched. He cannot love the new 4th q pecking order. Before tonight, in his games w Kyrie, Luka had taken 10 4th q shots to Kyrie's 33. THIS ISN'T WORKING.",N,,
AD wound up with good numbers - 28 & 19. But he wasn't much of a rim-protecting force - Memphis scored 86 in the paint. And the Lakers failed to cash so many chances - season high 26 turnovers. Just too sloppy. AD not That Guy without LeBron. Or at least DLo. Or even Russ.,,Y,neutral / slightly critical
"Lakers are still in this game, down 10 with 6:45 left. AD has played OK - 22 & 16. But he hasn't IMPOSED HIS WILL ON OFFENSE - just 7 of 17. He's the best player on the floor. He should display that down the stretch.",,,
"Wait, now Shams is reporting that LeBron's RIGHT foot - the one now in the medical boot - has been bothering him since January and that he played through IT??? What about the LEFT foot that kept him out the 3 games before the All-Star break??? I am so confused.",Y,,critical
"Did LeBron get an MRI, as was reported he would? Did he get 2nd/3rd opinions from foot specialists, as reported? No idea. He's still with the team in Memphis, even though the latest is the team will wait 2 weeks to evaluate his progress.",Y,,critical
"Near the end of the 1st quarter, LeBron walked (limped?) out to the Lakers' bench in Memphis wearing some kind of protective walking boot. What he did in Dallas, playing the entire 4th q on that foot, scoring 11 more pts, was nothing short of miraculous.",Y,,"critical, sarcastic"
"The mystery grows: For weeks neither the Lakers nor LeBron would say what was wrong with his LEFT foot. Ankle? Foot sprain? Toe? Now we're left in the dark about his RIGHT foot, which somehow was injured on a routine drive to the basket. If he ""heard something pop,"" what popped?",Y,,critical

Jimmy Butler just willed in a wild up-and-under through Embiid - Shot of Year candidate - that won the game for the Heat. Harden had a good look from 3 to save it but back-ironed.,N,,
"Just when I sing the praises of the Sixers and Embiid for MVP on Undisputed, they play a lifeless home first half vs a Miami that has lost 4 straight, trail by 8 at half. Joel: 14 and 4 rebs WITH 4 TURNOVERS. Unfocused. Unconscionable. Jimmy Butler embarrassing his ex-team",N,,
"Please explain how LeBron said he ""heard a pop"" when he went down yesterday - yet continued playing, scored 11 more pts, DHam said afterward LBJ is ""good"" ... and now Shams reports he could miss ""extended time""???
